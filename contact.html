    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>We care about New Zealand’s native birds and want to help protect them. Our group learns about the birds, where they live, and what they need to stay safe. We also try to clean up places where birds live so they don’t get hurt by rubbish or pollution. Sometimes we plant trees or tell other people how they can help too. It’s important to look after nature so future generations can enjoy it as well. We believe small actions can make a big difference.<br><br>
    If we don’t do anything, more of our native birds could disappear forever. Every person can make a difference, even by doing small things like picking up rubbish or planting trees. Birds are a special part of New Zealand and we should look after them. <br><br>
If you are walking somewhere and see trash make sure to pick it up and throw it in the bin, so creatures won't get harmmed by eatting that trash and just like that you could've just saved an animal life. We hope we can spread the word and keep NZ a safe enviorment.</p>
