    <h3>Kākāpō<br><span class="subheading">Critically Endangered</span></h3>

<p> The Kākāpō is a large green parrot that lives in New Zealand. There are only a few left because they were hunted and their forests were cut down. They also have trouble surviving because animals like stoats and rats eat their eggs. </p>

<p> How can we protect it? </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them safe on predator free islands</li>
<li>Help them breed in special programs</li>
<li>Donating to groups that help save native birds</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Threats</h3>
<p>Many of New Zealand’s native birds are in danger because of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Predators like rats, stoats, and possums that eat eggs and baby birds</li>
  <li>Habitat loss when forests are cut down for farming or houses</li>
  <li>Pollution and climate change, which make it harder for birds to survive</li>
  <li>Birds didn’t evolve with these predators, so they don’t know how to protect themselves</li>
</ul>
